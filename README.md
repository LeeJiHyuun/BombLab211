# 1 Introduction
  The nefarious Dr. Evil has planted a slew of “binary bombs” on our class machines. A binary bomb is a
  program that consists of a sequence of phases. Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin.
  If you type the correct string, then the phase is defused and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise,
  the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase
  has been defused.
  There are too many bombs for us to deal with, so we are giving each student a bomb to defuse. Your mission,
  which you have no choice but to accept, is to defuse your bomb before the due date. Good luck, and
  welcome to the bomb squad!
